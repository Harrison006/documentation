## My IT journey

My IT journey started back when i was around 8-9ish when i got given an old Windows XP pc from my Mum and dad, and from there it started, from there i got handed randome laptops from my parents friends and i used to do a bunch, used to make game servers for my buddies, ways to get around the school internet.

My now understanding is much much greater now, the basic principals i used to know i have greatly expanded into now, ive now got such a massive Home lab with over powered servers for what i do, But i appreciate everything i own and how. Ive come a long way from where i started out, just running vms on my main desktop and evaluating them there, but i loved the aspect of running a proper production environment that i could test and delpoy products i had used on my time at QML on work experience.

At QML i was using AD and SCCM (MECM) (for my first time in the wild), my first time there inspired me so much to start learning the basic principals i needed In the Sytems admin / Network Admin space. From there i learned Windows Server Management, I learned how to use SCCM to image devices, Learnt a little about the basic troubleshooting of citrix appservers.

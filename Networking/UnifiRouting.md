# Dont buy a unfi Console
Why?

Why would you?, they dont have any features that are remoteley useful, yes the UI might be easy but So what, they dont have any sort of timeline public, they dont have a good update scheme (5th oct 2022) The DMP is useless atm

Your Better off with a mix of unifi and a PFsense router

Or if your feeling up to it a NFTables router

If your going to go ubiquiti **dont**

Cisco isnt any better, Aruba is targeted at enterprise, HPE definatly isnt
Juniper isnt

#
There isnt any other company that sells there switches to the public like this

Unifi switches are Amazing and same with their AP's but their routers need work
